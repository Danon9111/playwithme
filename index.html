                        <p>Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up
                            before dinner. But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters… You can
                            waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! All right,
                            come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let’s go. Uncle Owen… Yeah?This R2
                            unit has a bad motivator. Look! Hey, what’re you trying to push on us? Excuse me, sir, but
                            that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. Uncle Owen… Yeah? What about that one?
                            What about that blue one? We’ll take that one. Yeah, take it away.

                        <p>Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back
                            to the ship and get her ready. You’ll have to sell your speeder. That’s okay. I’m never coming
                            back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just
                            going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I’ve got his money. It’s too late. You should have paid
                            him when you had the chance. Jabba’s put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter
                            in the galaxy will be looking for you. I’m lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got
                            the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don’t have it with me. Tell
                            Jabba…
